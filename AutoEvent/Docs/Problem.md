# Problems :trollface:
### *You may encounter a problem because of which the mini-games will not run.*
### *So I left hints on how to fix the problems:*
----
 >  You do not have permission to use this command
 - You didn't grant the rights for the role. [(Look at the point "2. Permission")](https://github.com/KoT0XleB/AutoEvent-Exiled/blob/main/Docs/Installation.md)
----
 >  Only 1 argument is needed - the command name of the event!
 - You have run the command incorrectly. [(Follow this link to understand)](https://github.com/KoT0XleB/AutoEvent-Exiled/blob/main/Docs/Commands.md)
----
 >  The event was not found, nothing happened.
 - This is the most common cause, but it's easy to fix. There may be several reasons:
    - You have installed the plugins incorrectly. [(Try again.)](https://github.com/KoT0XleB/AutoEvent-Exiled/blob/main/Docs/Installation.md)
    - Or the problem is that you have not installed [Maps](https://github.com/KoT0XleB/AutoEvent-Exiled/tree/main/Schematics) and [Music](https://github.com/KoT0XleB/AutoEvent-Exiled/tree/main/Music).
    - The problem may be in MapEditorReborn, which depends on the Exiled version. Make sure that MER is working.
